# Hybrid Movie Recommender System

This project builds a hybrid movie recommender combining collaborative,
content‑based, and expert system methods. It uses the MovieLens dataset to
predict ratings, generate recommendations, and reorder them for accuracy,
relevance, and explainability. The system includes both personalised and
non‑personalised evaluation to compare performance.
